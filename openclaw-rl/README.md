# Binary Reward Summarized from Next State

Online RL for agentic tool-use, using binary process reward signals from environment feedback.

## Method Overview

The policy model is deployed as an OpenAI-compatible chat proxy. External environments (e.g. OpenClaw) send multi-turn conversations through this proxy. For each **main-line turn**, the system:

1. Forwards the request to the policy model (served by SGLang) and collects the response along with per-token log-probabilities.
2. When the **next turn** arrives, its user/environment message serves as the "next state" for the previous turn.
3. A **Process Reward Model (PRM)** judges the previous response quality given the next state (could be user or env feedback). It produces `m` independent evaluations via majority vote, scoring each turn as `+1` (good), `-1` (bad), or `0` (neutral).
4. The majority-voted score becomes the scalar reward for that turn.
5. Turns that never receive a next state (i.e. the last turn in a session) are excluded from training (`loss_mask = 0`), unless they are the only turn in the session (at-least-one guarantee).

### Advantage Estimation (GRPO)

Advantages are computed using **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**. For each sample with scalar reward `r`, the advantage is broadcast uniformly to all response tokens:

$$A_t = r, \quad \forall t \in \text{response tokens}$$

No reward normalization is applied (`--disable-rewards-normalization`).

### Policy Gradient Loss

Standard PPO-style clipped surrogate objective with asymmetric clipping:

$$\rho_t = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t \mid s_t)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(a_t \mid s_t)}$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{pg}} = -\mathbb{E}_t\Big[\min\!\big(\rho_t A_t,\ \text{clip}(\rho_t,\, 1-\varepsilon,\, 1+\varepsilon_{\text{high}}) \cdot A_t\big)\Big]$$

where $\varepsilon = 0.2$, $\varepsilon_{\text{high}} = 0.28$.

### Total Loss

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pg}} + \beta_{\text{KL}} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}$$

where $\beta_{\text{KL}} = 0.02$. Entropy bonus is disabled ($\beta_{\text{ent}} = 0$).
